• Tools and Technologies Used.

• Prerequisite Tools:

1: Visual Studio 2019 
2: Microsoft SQL server 2014

• Technologies Used:

1: Bootstrap for Responsive design 

2: Jquery 

3: Javascript 4: 

4: C# MVC 

5: Entity Framework

6: MSSQL Server

• Application Flow:

Two Projects are added. 

1: C# MVC for user Interface (Login page, and Dashboard Page)
